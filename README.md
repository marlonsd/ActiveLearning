ActiveLearning
==============

Implementation of common active learning strategies. Currently supported strategies include:

1. Random sampling
2. Uncertainty sampling
3. Log-gain

Upcoming strategies:

1. Query-by-committee
2. Expected error reduction

Future work:

1. Annotating features
2. Tandem learning - annotating instances and features jointly

Current Limitations:

1. The code currently assumes binary classification.
